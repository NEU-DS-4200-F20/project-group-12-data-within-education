  <h1>Abstract</h1>

  <p>One of the biggest dilemmas within the current use of technology for education is the fact that massive amounts of student data is being left untapped at the expense of the opportunity to aid instructors. Keo LMS, a learning management system company, has provided this team with key student data ranging from click rates to student submission cycles. Leveraging this meaningful student performance data, data will be visualized to provide a platform to help online educators transform the way they digest their students’ online patterns.
    Keywords: Educators, Students, Performance</p>


  <h1>Visualization</h1>

  <p>Below are two visualization designs. One includes a table and scatterplot. The other includes a table and line chart.
  </p>
  <p>The objective of the first scatterplot visualization is for the end user to quickly identify grade trends as it correlates to time spent on a quiz assignment. Many institutions that exclusively utilize mock tests as a tool find such visualization especially useful as it can be directly used to improve student time management skills.</p>
  <p>The second linegraph visualization aims at providing the end user with data to show a student performance over time. Such tools can be utilized to quickly identify sudden changes in average grades to provide further help.</p>
  <p>The data within this current example does nto reflect real student data, structure of classes and grades along with data structure from existing classes and the Keo platform was taken to generate a sanitised dataset.</p>
  <!--<p>
    The scatterplot and table chart interact with each other via brushing and linking and details on demand. The scatterplot shows all the quiz and test scores for a class plotted against the time spent on those tasks. The scatterplot itself is zoomable after a brush has been applied. After brushing the scatterplot, not only with the zoom functionality apply, but the table will refresh with the corresponding data that has been brushed. This essentiality turns the table into an extended tooltip that provides more detail on the datapoint that have been brushed (details on demand). Highlighting table rows results in scatter points being ‘pop’d out’ via a grey fill and non-selected scatter points being faded out in the background. To reset both the table selections and scatterplot zoom please double click on the scatterplot.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    The line chart and table interact with each other via linking and details on demand. The line chart shows the average grade throughout a semester of a student. Selecting new students from the drop-down arrow results in a new table containing the grade data of the new student. Here, once again, the table acts as details on demand, providing a detailed view of the line chart data that only shows average grades and deadlines.

  <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

  <p>The scatterplot and table visualization accomplishes domain tasks two and three. These domain tasks were position of time spent by overall grade and visualization of classwork grades, respectively. The line chart and table visualization satisfy domain tasks one and four. These domain tasks were visualization of class grades and average grades per student.</p>

 

    <p>In terms of interactivity, the scatterplot and table visualization utilize brushing and linking, zooming, and also details on demand. Details on demand are provided when a group of scatter points are brushed over and the table correspondingly adjusts to only include the datapoints that have been brushed. The table provides more details than just the scatterplot can inform the user. Double clicking on the scatterplot resets the zoom level to normal and resets the table to include all original data. For the line chart and table, the visualization leverages linking and details on demand (details are provided for each student after a student is selected from the drop-down arrow).</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Color schemes for both charts were chosen from primary color pallets as colors were used to encode categorical variables like class type. For the scatterplot, selected circles were filled with light grey so that the colored outline of each circle still could stick out. When table rows are selected, the circles that are not correspondingly selected have a reduced opacity so that they allow the selected circles to pop out (which remain at normal opacity). Selected rows from the first table are highlighted in a pink shade.</p>
